The game can be set up in the desired number of digits (from 1-digit to 9-digit numbers) by creating numbers with the numbers between 0-9.
rkm=4 (number of digits is 4) rkm=9 (number of digits is 9) 
The computer guesses a number, and the user provides positive and negative clues.
Users can give incorrect clues multiple times :)
But the computer always finds the number eventually!
The entire code is just 114 lines! :)
